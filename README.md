# Eventus

Sequential, distributed disk-backed event store database built in Rust.

Still very much WIP. For more info, there's a [blog post explaining how Eventus works behind the scenes](https://theari.dev/blog/building-a-rust-powered-event-store/).

## Credits

The segment based architecture was inspired by [AxonServer](https://www.axoniq.io/products/axon-server).
